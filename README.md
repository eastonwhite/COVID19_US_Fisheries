# COVID-19 and US fisheries

This repository contains code and data for a forthcoming article: *Early effects of COVID-19 interventions on US fisheries and seafood*. A preprint is available at https://osf.io/9bxnh/. This repository is organized as follows:

- An R markdown document that contains code to produce the figures and analyses found in the manuscript. 
- cleaned_data/ folder with data files that have been cleaned and filtered to be used in the R markdown script. 
- scripts/ folder with various R scripts to perform data downloads, clean and filter data, and run analyses found in R markdown document. 

All of the data used in the R markdown document is available in the cleaned_data/ folder with one exception. The business foot traffic data comes from the company Safegraph (safegraph.com/). The company has made the data freely available to researchers who join their group at: https://www.safegraph.com/dashboard/covid19-commerce-patterns

The code, and corresponding packages, were used with R version 4.0.0 (2020-04-24)
